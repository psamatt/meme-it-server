# Team Contributions Log

This file serves as a log of individual contributions made by each team member throughout the course. Before each meeting, team members are required to manually append two development tasks they completed during the previous week to this markdown file. Each entry should include the week date, name, links to the GitHub issues they worked on, and optionally a short description of their work.
